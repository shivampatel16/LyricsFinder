# LyricsFinder

This project was the fourth among the 5 amazing projects of the '95-702 - Distributed Systems for Information Systems Management' course at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). The course was taught by 3 eminent Professors of CMU - Prof. Mike McCarthy, Prof. Joe Mertz and Prof. Marty Barrett.

- Designed and constructed a distributed lyrics search tool comprising a mobile application that sends HTTP requests to a web service hosted on Heroku, which retrieves the requested lyrics from Vagalume - a third-party API.

- Implemented CRUD operations programmatically from a Java program to the MongoDB database to store logs persistently and make them available across restarts of the application.

- Created a web-based interface that displays logging and analytics related to the application.

- Incorporated error handling mechanisms for invalid inputs, network failures, and unavailable or invalid data from third-party API.
